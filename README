//////////// DESCRIPTION

This application is intended to guide people to decide when to bet.

It's far from being perfect and sometimes it misses the shot, but it helps telling when to bet and when to stay safe.

This app has been prepared to be usable from mobile phones. In fact it works pretty well on iPhones, but the horizontal sliding is a problem on android devices so, right now only desktop browsers and iPhones (also iPads and iPod touchs) can use it.


////////////////////////////////////
//////////// LANGUAGES

Right now this application only supports english and spanish languages, but including new languages shouldn't be a problem.

The only addition that has to be done is on the file:
/javascript/script.js

Adding the new language on the appropiate variable
var msg = {

And allowing to set the language from options menu:
setLanguage(language)


////////////////////////////////////
///////////// HOW TO USE IT

You are supposed to be playing against some opponents, and you have to choose the cards that are being revealed to get the proper percentages of victory


////////////////////////////////////
//////////// DETAILS

This application uses HTML5 and cache storage, so it can be used offline and emulates the behaviour of a native app on iPhones.


////////////////////////////////////
///////////// IMPROVEMENTS

See "TODO" file for further details.
- Horizontal scrolling
